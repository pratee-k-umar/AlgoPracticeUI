## Installation & Setup

Follow the steps below to set up the frontend locally:

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/pratee-k-umar/AlgoPracticeUI.git
   cd client
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**

   Ensure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed, then run:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Configure Environment Variables:**

   Create a `.env.local` file at the root of the project and add your configuration. For example:

   ```env
   NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://api.yourdomain.com
   NEXT_PUBLIC_JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_key
   ```

4. **Run the Development Server:**

   Start the Next.js development server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   The app should now be running on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## Production Build

To create a production-ready build of the project:

```bash
npm run build
npm start
```

The production server will start and serve optimized pages with server-side rendering.

## API Integration

The frontend communicates with a backend via RESTful API endpoints. Ensure that:
- The API endpoints are correctly specified in your environment configuration.
- JWT tokens are handled securely for user authentication.
- You manage error handling and loading states effectively to improve user experience.

## Future Enhancements

- **Improved Real-Time Features:** Enhance interactivity with real-time notifications and updates.
- **Mobile Optimization:** Further refine the UI/UX for mobile devices.
- **Advanced Code Editor:** Integrate additional tools and plugins to improve coding challenge experiences.
- **Localization:** Support multiple languages for a broader audience.
